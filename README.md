# 🚢 Titanic Survival Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Author:** Rohan Duraipandian  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📋 Overview  
This project explores the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to uncover patterns that influenced passenger survival. The goal is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features like age, gender, class, and survival rate.

---

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset  
- Explore survival patterns by demographic and ticket class  
- Visualize relationships between key variables  
- Generate insights that could be used for feature engineering in predictive models

---

## 🧪 Techniques Used  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and reformatted columns  
- **Feature Exploration:** Focused on `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, and `Embarked`  
- **Visualizations:**  
  - Survival rate by class and gender  
  - Age distribution among survivors vs. non-survivors  
  - Fare distribution by survival status  
  - Heatmap of feature correlations  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Gender Matters:** Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate  
- **Class Divide:** First-class passengers were more likely to survive  
- **Younger Passengers:** Higher survival rates observed among children  
- **Fare Factor:** Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival odds

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Use insights for feature engineering in a classification model  
- Apply logistic regression or decision trees to predict survival  
- Tune models using cross-validation and grid search
